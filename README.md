# First-AB-Test
This project I completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree program. In this repo, you will see an A-B test comparing 2 website pages (old "control" and new "treatment")
The main point of this A-B test is to reject the null hypothesis and go through a few different ways of finding out if we reject the null. 
The null hypothesis is that we see a larger conversion rate with the old web page than the new web page. 
All data was provided by Udacity. Hope you enjoy and learn about A-B testing as I did.
